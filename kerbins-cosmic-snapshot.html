        <p class="lead"><strong>Mission Brief:</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">The newly established Kerbal Space Exploration Agency (KSEA) has embarked on its inaugural mission, "Kerbin's Cosmic Snapshot." This mission marks a significant milestone in Kerbal space exploration as it endeavors to send a Kerbonaut and a state-of-the-art telescope into the final frontier.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Design and Build the "Cosmic Eye"</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">The heart of the mission lies in the deployment of the telescope, known as the "Cosmic Eye," designed to capture breathtaking images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and other celestial wonders from the vantage point of space. The telescope is equipped with advanced imaging technology, including multi-spectral sensors and high-resolution cameras, allowing for unprecedented clarity and detail in the captured images.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Launch a specialized telescope into space aboard a rocket</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">To accomplish this feat, a specially designed spacecraft must carry both the telescope and a brave Kerbonaut. The spacecraft, named "Stargazer," must be equipped with powerful boosters and precise maneuvering thrusters to facilitate a smooth ascent into orbit and ensure precise positioning of the telescope.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Position the telescope in a stable orbit around Kerbin.</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Upon reaching the desired orbital altitude around Kerbin, the Stargazer will carefully deploy the Cosmic Eye, allowing it to unfold and initialize its systems for data collection. Once operational, the telescope will begin its cosmic survey, capturing stunning images of distant stars, planets, and celestial phenomena.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Safely return the Kerbonaut and the telescope back to Kerbin.</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">However, the mission isn't just about exploration; it's also about the safe return of the Kerbonaut and the valuable data collected by the telescope. After completing its imaging tasks, the Cosmic Eye will be carefully stowed back into the Stargazer, ensuring its protection during reentry into Kerbin's atmosphere.</p>
