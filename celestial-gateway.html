        <p class="lead"><strong>Mission Brief:</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Embark on a groundbreaking mission to establish a permanent gateway in orbit around Kerbin, serving as a crucial hub for future space exploration endeavors. Lead a team of Kerbal engineers and scientists as you construct and deploy the Celestial Gateway, marking a new era of space exploration for the Kerbal Space Program.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Gateway Construction</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Design and assemble the components necessary to construct the Celestial Gateway in orbit around Kerbin. Coordinate launches of modular segments, including habitation modules, docking ports, solar arrays, and propulsion systems, ensuring compatibility and structural integrity.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Orbital Assembly</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Utilize advanced rendezvous and docking techniques to assemble the modular segments of the Celestial Gateway in orbit around Kerbin. Overcome challenges such as orbital inclination adjustments and precise alignment to achieve a stable and functional configuration.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Establish Infrastructure</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Deploy essential infrastructure and systems within the Celestial Gateway to support crewed missions, including life support systems, power generation, communication arrays, and navigation aids. Ensure the gateway is equipped to sustain long-duration missions and serve as a logistical hub for interplanetary travel.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Gateway Operations</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Initiate operations of the Celestial Gateway, including crew rotations, resupply missions, and scientific research activities. Maintain regular communication with ground control and coordinate mission schedules to optimize efficiency and productivity.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Gateway Expansion</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Plan and execute expansion missions to enhance the capabilities of the Celestial Gateway, incorporating additional modules and facilities to accommodate growing demands for space exploration. Consideration should be given to future missions beyond the Kerbin system.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Interplanetary Missions</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Utilize the Celestial Gateway as a staging point for interplanetary missions, facilitating crew transfers, refueling, and equipment exchange for expeditions to other celestial bodies within the Kerbol system. Demonstrate the versatility and strategic importance of the gateway in advancing Kerbal space exploration.</p>
