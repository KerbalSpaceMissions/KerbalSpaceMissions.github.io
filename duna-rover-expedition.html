        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Mission Brief:</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">The Kerbal Space Exploration Agency (KSEA) embarks on an ambitious journey to explore the enigmatic red planet, Duna, through the "Duna Rover Expedition" mission. This endeavor represents a significant milestone in Kerbal space exploration, aiming to unveil the mysteries of Duna's surface and advance our understanding of celestial bodies beyond Kerbin.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Launch a spacecraft carrying a rover to explore the surface of Duna</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">The mission commences with the launch of the "Red Horizon" spacecraft, carrying the Duna rover, affectionately named "Exploro," aboard a powerful rocket. Following liftoff from Kerbin's surface, the spacecraft will embark on a precise Hohmann transfer orbit, aligning its trajectory with Duna's orbit around Kerbol.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Execute a precise Hohmann transfer orbit to intercept Duna's trajectory</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">En route to Duna, meticulous orbital calculations and trajectory adjustments will be made to optimize the spacecraft's path and ensure a successful intercept with the red planet. A carefully planned gravity assist maneuver with Duna's moon, Ike, will further refine the spacecraft's trajectory, maximizing efficiency and conserving precious fuel.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Orbit Duna and deploy a communication relay satellite facilitate data transmission.</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">Upon arrival at Duna, the Red Horizon will enter orbit around the planet, where it will deploy a communication relay satellite to facilitate real-time data transmission between the rover and mission control on Kerbin.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Objective: Land the rover on Duna</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">With communications established, the rover will be released from the spacecraft and descend to the surface of Duna using a precision landing system. Equipped with a suite of scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and drills, Exploro will embark on an extensive exploration of Duna's surface, traversing rugged terrain, analyzing rock formations, and probing the planet's atmosphere for valuable data. Throughout its mission, the rover will transmit its findings back to Kerbin via the communication relay satellite.</p>
        <p class="lead">|</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Additional Objective: Red Horizon returns home</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">As the mission reaches its conclusion, the Red Horizon spacecraft will initiate its return journey to Kerbin, leaving the communication relay satellite in orbit around Duna for future missions. Upon reaching Kerbin's sphere of influence, the spacecraft will execute a series of maneuvers to adjust its trajectory for a safe reentry into Kerbin's atmosphere. With the successful return of the Red Horizon spacecraft to Kerbin's surface, accompanied by the invaluable data collected by the Duna rover, the Duna Rover Expedition will mark a monumental achievement in Kerbal space exploration, paving the way for future missions to explore the depths of the cosmos.</p>
